# SRZG-P-Truncator
A simple truncator script for Python 3.8 which does the hex editing required to extract files from Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity automatically, in batch.

Aims to properly truncate the 'OOCH' archives (.P and no extension) from Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity into files that can then be decrypted to .pack format using https://github.com/romhack/sonic_riders_lzss
Based off of the method by moester_ in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q65xyi4Rn-c
Place this script as a .py file into the folder with files you want to scan/truncate. Please make backups of the files if you want to revert any changes or in case there is an issue!
